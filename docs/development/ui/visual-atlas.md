# Skladno visual atlas

This atlas maps visual roles to Tailwind utilities and semantic tokens. `packages/web/src/design-tokens.css` owns their values for every theme. Feature code uses the mapped utility or token and does not copy raw colors, shadows, radii, font sizes, or tracking values. The static site uses these same tokens; `npm run dev:site` and Amplify copy them into `site/` before serving or deployment.

## Typography roles

| Role | Utilities | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product UI | `font-ui` | Navigation, controls, metadata, headings, panels, dialogs, and status text |
| Article content | `font-editor` | Article editing and article-length reading or review content |
| Article title | `font-ui text-xl leading-7 font-semibold tracking-tight` | Current Article title |
| Article body | `font-editor text-xl leading-8` | Draft text and Article previews |
| Panel title | `font-ui text-base leading-6 font-semibold` | Assistant and Workspace View titles |
| Introductory copy | `font-ui text-base leading-8 text-muted` | Quiet explanatory copy |
| Body | `font-ui text-base leading-6` | Findings, Proposal content, and supporting views |
| Supporting copy | `font-ui text-sm leading-5` | Dialogs, uncertainty, Settings, and transient messages |
| Body label | `font-ui text-sm leading-5 font-medium` | Article titles in the library |
| Control label | `font-ui text-xs leading-5 font-semibold` | Buttons and selected tabs |
| Metadata | `font-ui text-xs leading-4 text-muted` | Revision identifiers, timestamps, counts, and Article details |
| Status copy | `font-ui text-xs leading-5` | Banners, status blocks, and operation progress |
| Overline | `font-ui text-micro tracking-overline font-semibold uppercase` | Group labels and diff labels |
| Compact badge | `font-ui text-badge font-semibold` | Counts where space is fixed |
| Product identity | `font-ui text-base leading-6 font-semibold text-brand` | Skladno wordmark and collapsed `S` |

The application uses only `text-badge`, `text-micro`, `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, and `text-xl`. `text-lg` is reserved for compact decorative identity marks. Use `tracking-overline` only with `text-micro`.

## Text roles

| Meaning | Utility | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary content | `text-ink` | Default headings and readable body copy |
| Secondary content | `text-muted` | Metadata, hints, inactive tabs, and quiet empty states |
| Interactive or selected | `text-brand` | Links, selection, active workflow, and identity |
| Content on dark fills | `text-on-brand` | Brand actions and tooltips |
| Information | `text-info` | Neutral advisory status |
| Success | `text-success` | Saved, accepted, or completed state |
| Warning | `text-warning` | Saving, stale, or uncertain state |
| Danger | `text-danger` | Errors, rejection, removal, or destructive actions |

Opacity-derived text color is reserved for established placeholder treatment. State always has visible text plus an icon, label, pattern, border, or semantic element.

## Surface and interaction roles

| Token | Utility | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canvas` | `bg-canvas` | Outermost application canvas |
| `surface` | `bg-surface` | Supporting panels and quiet regions |
| `surface-supporting` | `bg-surface-supporting` | Elevated Library, Assistant, and Settings Navigation panels |
| `surface-raised` | `bg-surface-raised` | Fields, menus, dialogs, and cards |
| `editor-surface` | `bg-editor-surface` | Article writing and revision preview surfaces |
| `border` | `border-border` | Default separators and outlines |
| `border-strong` | `border-border-strong` | Stronger structural separation |
| `brand` | `text-brand`, `bg-brand`, `border-brand` | Primary actions, selection, identity, and links |
| `brand-hover` | `bg-brand-hover` | Solid-action hover |
| `brand-soft` | `bg-brand-soft` | Selected navigation and quiet hover |
| `focus` | `outline-focus` | Keyboard focus |
| `status-glow` | `shadow-status-glow` | Active work indicators |

Article body text uses `text-editor-ink`. In the dark theme it is softer and more neutral than the general UI ink so long-form reading stays legible without making every interface label brighter.

Use each semantic status foreground with its matching `*-soft` background through `Status`, `Banner`, or the relevant control state.

Proposal diffs use `diff-added`, `diff-added-stripe`, `diff-removed`, and `diff-removed-stripe`. Pair them with `ins` or `del` semantics, explicit labels, and structural borders or stripes.

## Application map

| Area | Surface | Primary role | Supporting role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Article Library Panel | `surface` | Body label | Overline and metadata |
| Article Header | `surface-raised` | Article title | Metadata and control label |
| Workspace Tab Bar | Workspace surface | Control label | Selected `brand` state |
| Article Editor | `surface-raised` | Article body | Metadata |
| Supporting Workspace Views | Workspace surface | Panel title and body | Metadata or status |
| Editorial Assistant Panel | `surface` | Panel title and introductory copy | Body, controls, and status |
| Article Status Bar | Inherited | Metadata | Semantic status |
| Application Settings | `canvas` with `surface-supporting` navigation and `surface-raised` controls | Panel title and supporting copy | Controls and status |
| Dialogs and menus | `surface-raised` | Panel title and body | Controls |

## Adding or changing a role

1. Reuse the role whose hierarchy and reading density match.
2. When none fits, define the semantic value in `styles.css` and its role here before using it.
3. Use the Tailwind token in feature code.
4. Verify WCAG AA contrast, keyboard focus, reduced motion, collapsed panels, and the 1280 x 800 and 1440 x 1024 layouts.
