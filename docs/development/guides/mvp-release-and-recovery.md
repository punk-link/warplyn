# MVP release, recovery, and limitations

Use this guide to prepare and verify the browser-based local-first MVP and unsigned Windows and Debian Electron previews. Ubuntu 22.04 x64 is the Linux release-validation baseline. Do not put credentials, an author's Article, or a production database in release evidence.

## Release checklist

1. Start from a clean worktree and install the locked dependencies with `npm ci`.
2. Run the release checks:

   ```powershell
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   npm run test:e2e
   npm run build
   npm run product:check
   ```

3. Complete the [accessibility release walkthrough](accessibility-release-walkthrough.md). Its unresolved manual blockers must have an explicit release decision and linked follow-up.
4. Run the clean-profile journey below using a new, empty `WARPLYN_DATA_DIR`. Use a disposable provider credential supplied outside the repository, or verify the non-AI steps without one.
5. Create a manual backup in a private test folder and complete the recovery drill. Record only command results, versions, and pass/fail outcomes.

## Clean-profile manual author journey

Set a new empty data folder for the local service, copy `.env.example` to an untracked `.env` only when AI verification is in scope, then run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:5173`.

1. In Settings, verify General, Key bindings, AI, Publishing, and Data & backups open. Select a backup folder that is private to the test account and create a manual backup.
2. Create an Article named `Release check` with the body `A short public release fixture.` and save a Revision.
3. Request an editorial improvement. Confirm the Article remains unchanged until a Proposal is explicitly accepted; accept it and confirm a new Revision appears.
4. In Revisions, restore the initial Revision and confirm restoration appends another Revision instead of rewriting history.
5. Request a fact check. Confirm Findings are advisory, cite sources, and do not alter the Article.
6. Configure a translation language, create a translation, and confirm it opens as a linked, independently editable Article.
   For translation freshness, configure Spanish and German, request both, and accept both as linked Articles. Save a source edit and confirm both show Outdated while their text and History remain unchanged. Open each translation and check its source-change warning. Regenerate Spanish, review its output, select Update existing translation, and confirm the named target. Confirm its title remains unchanged, History contains the old and new Revisions, and only Spanish becomes Current. Restore its earlier Revision and confirm it becomes Outdated again. Repeat with a retained target Draft and with a source edit during generation; neither may overwrite accepted text. Cancel a multi-language request and confirm no queued requests start and completed results remain available. Request another translation from an unchanged source and confirm creating it preserves existing translations.
7. Use the Status Bar Copy control for Markdown and plain text. Confirm it copies output only; it must not publish to a platform.
8. Restart the service and confirm the Articles, Revisions, settings, and backup policy remain available.

Mark a step failed if it silently changes the Article, loses Revision history, exposes a credential, or cannot be recovered. Capture a linked defect rather than substituting private content in the report.

## Article file acceptance

Use disposable Articles and files for these checks:

- In Windows and Ubuntu packaged apps, verify real open/save/cancel dialogs, overwrite confirmation, unreadable input, unwritable destinations, Unicode filenames and content, whole historical Revision export, and restart recovery.
- In the browser, verify picker cancellation and reselection, download preferences, later download-manager cancellation, and accurate download-started feedback.
- In both runtimes, verify header and Library file actions, Tab/Shift+Tab focus areas, screen-reader names and notifications, and collapsed/responsive Article and Revision controls.

On 2026-10-02, the maintainer reported all manual checks from the Article Markdown files plan passed. This records maintainer acceptance; repeat the checks for future releases when file operations change.

## Recovery drill

This drill proves recovery from a backup snapshot; it intentionally replaces the active database. Use the clean-profile data folder, not a maintainer's working data.

1. In Electron or the web app, choose **Restore a backup** in Data & backups and select a manual backup from the configured folder.
2. Confirm the selected filename and replacement warning. Electron restarts; the web app reloads after the loopback service reopens the restored database.
3. Verify the Article, Revision history, Draft checkpoint, Assistant history, style data, and Settings state from before the backup are present.
4. Repeat with an incompatible snapshot and confirm the active data remains available after the failure.
5. Record pass/fail, the application revision, OS and browser version, and the backup filename. Do not record the data-folder path if it identifies an author or shared location.

If backup creation fails, leave the active database alone, check the folder permission, and retry. Browser backups require a browser with directory-picker support and retained folder permission. Manual backups are never removed by automatic-backup retention.

## Release boundaries

Verify local data and recovery against [ADR-005](../architecture/adr-005-article-state-and-consistency.md) and [ADR-006](../architecture/adr-006-sqlite-lifecycle-and-recovery.md). Verify diagnostics, AI completion and storage, and renderer isolation against [ADR-004](../architecture/adr-004-local-diagnostics.md), [ADR-007](../architecture/adr-007-completion-gated-editorial-engine.md), and [ADR-008](../architecture/adr-008-loopback-service-trust-boundary.md).

The supported releases are the browser-based local-first MVP and the unsigned Windows and Debian previews described below. Ubuntu 22.04 x64 is the Linux release-validation baseline; compatible Debian-based distributions may use the same package. The [cross-cutting inventory](../product/cross-cutting-inventory.md) owns deferred product boundaries. Publishing profiles remain guidance and Copy remains the only publishing action.

## Windows Electron preview

The release target is Windows 11 x64. Stable releases and prereleases are unsigned, so Windows may show a SmartScreen warning. GitHub release updates are optional and author-controlled. Stable builds default to stable-only updates, preview builds default to including prereleases, and About Settings can change the channel. Signing remains in [warplyn#41](https://github.com/punk-link/warplyn/issues/41). Native backup folder selection, Explorer reveal, and manual snapshots use the restricted desktop Settings client.

Build the unpacked application with `npm run package:electron`, or build the Squirrel.Windows installer with `npm run make:electron`. Both commands build the existing React application first. The packaged renderer uses local IPC and does not require the loopback HTTP server.

The release workflow uses the `WARPLYN_POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY` variable from the GitHub `Production` environment. Set it to the approved public capture key. The workflow fixes the endpoint to `https://us.i.posthog.com/batch`; it never packages an admin token. A missing variable blocks a telemetry-enabled release rather than making an installed app depend on a shell variable. Before release, manually verify the packaged Settings switch through opt-out, restart, re-enable, offline delivery, and shutdown with a pending Draft checkpoint. Verify PostHog account access, retention, IP handling, and stored payloads only in that authorized release workflow.

Environment-variable credentials remain supported. Managed credentials use Windows Credential Manager and never enter SQLite, backup snapshots, or renderer responses. The installer does not create or import a `.env` file.

Run `npm run release` to release the next stable patch or `npm run release -- 1.2.3` to release an explicit stable version. Run `npm run release:preview` from a stable version to start the next patch's preview series, or from a preview to advance that series. Use `npm run release:preview -- 1.2.3` to release the next available preview of `1.2.3`. Both commands require a clean worktree, update both package versions and the lockfile, run verification, commit, tag, and atomically push the commit and tag.

If a tag exists without a release, run `gh workflow run electron-windows.yml -f tag=v1.2.3` after the workflow change reaches the default branch.

For each stable Windows release, CI generates and validates WinGet manifests from the built installer and saves a `winget-v<version>` workflow artifact. Complete the disposable installation, upgrade, and uninstall checks before submitting it using the [WinGet submission procedure](../../../distribution/winget/README.md). Preview releases do not generate WinGet manifests.

### Desktop acceptance scenario

Run this pass with a disposable `WARPLYN_DATA_DIR` and no private content:

1. Install and launch the x64 preview. Record the expected unsigned-app warning. Confirm the Desktop and Start menu shortcuts are created, the workspace opens, then launch Warplyn again and confirm the existing window restores and receives focus.
2. Complete the clean-profile author journey above through Article creation, Draft checkpointing, Revision save and restore, Proposal acceptance, fact checking, translation, Settings, theme changes, keyboard navigation, and Copy. In Settings, add a managed API key, verify its connection, restart the app, verify it again, then remove the inactive connection. Confirm the key is held only in Windows Credential Manager and the app does not start the HTTP server.
3. Open HTTP and HTTPS links and confirm they use the system browser. Confirm file and custom-scheme navigation does not open. Test light and dark themes and the Windows 11 keyboard accessibility pass.
4. Remove the configured provider credential, retry an AI operation, and confirm the UI reports the unavailable configuration without exposing provider details. Repeat while offline, cancel an in-progress request, and confirm incomplete output does not change the Article.
5. Edit the active Article and close the window before the normal checkpoint delay. Restart and confirm the Draft reopens. Exercise the failed-checkpoint dialog with a disposable unwritable or conflicted fixture and verify both returning to the Article and explicitly quitting without the latest checkpoint.
6. Restart and confirm Articles, Drafts, Revisions, Settings, Findings, and completed Assistant output persist. Upgrade or reinstall over the same data directory and repeat the check.
7. In Data & backups, request Delete all local data and cancel the native confirmation; verify the disposable data is unchanged. Repeat with Create backup and delete, confirm the app exits, and verify only the disposable data directory was removed. Restart to confirm a new empty local profile opens.
8. With a separate disposable profile, uninstall Warplyn. Confirm the installer removed the application but left that profile’s `.warplyn` directory unchanged, then remove the disposable data manually.

### Preview update drill

Create a public GitHub prerelease with the setup executable, `RELEASES`, and full `.nupkg`. Install an older preview into a disposable profile, create an Article, Draft, Revision, and Settings change, then use About Settings to allow update network access, check, explicitly download, and Restart and update. Confirm all data reopens and the update status becomes current.

Exercise failed discovery, failed download, and failed snapshot paths. A failed checkpoint or snapshot must leave the existing preview open. For a failed upgraded startup, follow the public [update recovery guide](https://warplyn.com/docs/update-recovery.html): reinstall the previous preview and restore its matching pre-update snapshot. Record old and new versions, Windows architecture, pass/fail, recovery result, and remaining checks without private paths or Article content.

Mark the desktop pass failed if the renderer gains Node, filesystem, database, credential, or unrestricted IPC access; if generated content changes an Article without approval; or if install, upgrade, reinstall, or uninstall changes `.warplyn` data.

## Debian Electron preview

The release-validation target is Ubuntu 22.04 x64. Compatible Debian-based distributions may install the same package when their glibc and Secret Service environment are compatible, but become guaranteed targets only after this pass succeeds there. Build the Debian package with `npm run make:electron:linux`. Install the `.deb` through the system package manager; About Settings can, with the author's permission, check GitHub for a newer matching Debian release and open its release notes. Installation remains a manual package-manager upgrade or `.deb` reinstall.

Run the Desktop acceptance scenario above on an installed `.deb`, using GNOME Keyring or the distribution's Secret Service for the managed-credential checks. Also verify locked and unavailable Secret Service states leave Article editing and environment-variable connections usable, launcher integration opens one focused window, file picking and folder reveal work, and upgrade, reinstall, and uninstall preserve the disposable `.warplyn` data. Record the package version, distribution and version, architecture, pass/fail, and remaining checks without credentials, Article content, or private paths.

## Warplyn migration release boundary

`punk-link/warplyn` publishes only Warplyn packages. The inherited tags contain Skladno source and are not Warplyn releases; never dispatch a release against one. Current release workflows reject legacy product metadata before packaging. Continue the existing version sequence: the inherited stable baseline is `v0.5.5`, so the first published Warplyn version must be newer. Local migration test artifacts can use `0.5.5` without being published.

Use the supported [migration procedure](https://warplyn.com/docs/migration.html): export through Skladno's manual backup, install Warplyn separately, restore with native replacement confirmation, re-add managed API keys, select replacement connection/model roles, and choose backup/network/telemetry preferences again. Never copy a live WAL database, runtime settings, `.env` values, or legacy credentials. Keep both profiles and source backup pairs available.

Before publication, record independent install/launch/uninstall results for both apps, the installed Skladno `v0.5.5` and `v0.4.0-preview.3` backup journeys, and a second-version Warplyn update drill. Automated restore, credential, and packaging checks do not replace those installed acceptance gates. Publish Warplyn installers and the working migration page before the final legacy announcement. Do not enable site or release deployment while the public documentation routes remain broken.
