# ADR-006: Local data uses forward-only SQLite migrations and snapshot recovery

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-21
- Scope: Local persistence, schema migration, backups, and recovery
- Depends on: [ADR-001](adr-001-three-layer-server-and-electron.md), [ADR-005](adr-005-article-state-and-consistency.md), [ADR-009](adr-009-native-settings-credentials-and-data-switching.md)

## Context

Skladno stores private author data locally and must upgrade it without a remote migration service. Schema changes, interrupted starts, and recovery must not rewrite Article history or expose credentials.

## Decision

SQLite is the local system of record. The service enables foreign keys and WAL mode. Schema changes are ordered, forward-only migrations recorded in `schema_migrations`; each unapplied migration runs in one immediate transaction.

The pre-Article prototype schema is no longer supported. Startup does not detect or delete prototype databases. Supported Article schemas migrate forward without deleting the database.

Backups include a consistent SQLite snapshot. New browser backup folders also contain current Author Skills, immutable Skill Revision history, and a manifest of file sizes and SHA-256 hashes; native snapshots use a manifest-bearing companion folder for those files. Environment files and credentials remain excluded. Automatic retention never deletes manual backups. Legacy database-only snapshots remain restorable without changing Skill files. Bundle restore verifies the manifest before replacing the active database and Skill directories, followed by application-level verification of Articles, Revisions, and Settings. The browser service retains a complete recovery copy of prior database and Skill files and uses a startup marker to roll back an interrupted switch.

On POSIX, Skladno restricts its data directory and database files to the current user. Windows and browser-selected folder access use platform permissions. Native Windows Settings operations follow the restricted desktop boundary in ADR-009.

## Consequences

Migrations stay small and auditable, and recovery does not require a second persistence format. Downgrade migrations, in-place restore, and upgrades from the pre-Article prototype are unsupported.

## Verification

Database and backup tests cover ordered transactional migrations, repository recovery, snapshot creation, retention, and permissions where the platform exposes them. The release recovery drill verifies a real snapshot without using private production data.

## Skladno backup compatibility in Warplyn

Warplyn retains `skladno.sqlite`, the existing schema migrations, native `.sqlite` snapshots, Skill companion manifest format `1`, and browser `.skladno` bundles. Product-name prefixes are not restore validation criteria. Snapshot validation opens a private temporary copy because read-only SQLite connections can create WAL sidecars beside the source. Restore never rewrites the source backup or immutable Revisions. Database-only snapshots leave destination Skill files unchanged.
