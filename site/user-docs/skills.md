# Skills

*Skills* are local Markdown instruction packages. They help the Assistant choose and sequence editorial capabilities. They do not add permissions or make changes to an *Article*.

Ask the Assistant to create a reusable *Skill* in plain language. Explain the repeated job and any rules or references it needs. If a missing detail would change the *Skill*, the Assistant asks a short follow-up instead of guessing.

::: tip Example
If you often revise fiction, ask: “Create a *Skill* called ‘Fiction line edit’. Tighten sentences while preserving the narrator’s voice, character names, and events. Don’t add details; flag passages that are unclear instead.” The Assistant can reuse those instructions whenever you ask for a line edit.

*Example Skill creation request in the Composer. Connect a provider before sending it.*

After a successful creation, the *Skill* is available for new Assistant requests immediately. The creation request does not send your *Article* body to the model and does not change the *Article*, *Draft*, *Proposal*, or *Revision*.

Each created *Skill* has a local, immutable *Skill Revision* history. This is separate from *Article* Revision history. You can also edit the local Markdown package directly. Warplyn refreshes the catalog for the next request. Removing its `SKILL.md` file removes it from the available *Skills* list.

Ask the Assistant to revise or delete a *Skill* by name. It reads the current package before changing it and checks whether the file changed in the meantime. A revision keeps the *Skill* ID and adds a new *Skill Revision*. Deletion removes the *Skill* from new requests but retains its history.

To restore earlier instructions, ask for that *Skill*'s *Revisions* and identify the one to restore. Restoration writes a new live version and appends another *Skill Revision*. You can also restore a deleted *Skill* this way. Restoring an Assistant chat checkpoint does not restore or change any *Skill*; *Skill* restoration is a separate request.
